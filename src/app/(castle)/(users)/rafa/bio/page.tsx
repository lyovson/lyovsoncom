        Hey, I’m Rafael Avetisyan, but friends call me Lyovson. Born on
        September 8, 1991, in Yerevan, USSR—just 13 days before Armenia declared
        its independence—I’ve lived through and participated in some of the most
        pivotal moments in my country’s recent history.

        My formative years were spent at Daniel Varoujan School No. 89
        from 1998 to 2008. I was a diligent student, but my interests always
        stretched far beyond the classroom. From 2008 to 2011, I dived into
        Theology at Yerevan State University, exploring the history and
        philosophy of various religions. Though I never completed my degree,
        this period ignited a lifelong fascination with diverse cultural and
        philosophical topics. Duty called, and I served in the Armenian army
        from December 2011 to December 2013, emerging as a Sergeant and AGS-17
        specialist.

        During my university days and before my army stint, I worked as an
        assistant to Serj Gabyan, a music
        video and aspiring movie director. Post-army, mid-2014 saw me joining Ginosi, a company renting apartments in the US. It was here I met my future wife, Hasmik Khachunts—now Jess Lyovson. We tied the knot within a year and soon
        after started a marketing business with old pals like Serj and
       Alen Simonyan.
        Our venture was RoadCorp Inc. in the US, and Bismark Marketing in
        Armenia, working with top-tier artists and businesses.

        The political scene in Armenia was a rollercoaster, with major protests
        in 2015, 2016, and especially 2018. Jess and I were right in the thick
        of it. In 2016, we joined Nikol Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party on Alen's suggestion. Our party pulled off the 2018 Velvet Revolution,
        toppling the government. While our comrades transitioned into government
        roles, Jess and I managed the party's daily affairs and prepped for
        elections, putting our business activities on hold. By the end of 2018,
        we were elected as Yerevan City Council members, serving until 2023.

        While at Ginosi, I discovered my true passion—coding. Starting with
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I soon moved on to React and other web
        development libraries and frameworks. By 2019, I was freelancing,
        evolving from WordPress to cutting-edge tech like Next.js and Payload
        CMS.

        In 2021, my friend Eduard Avetisyan, a Bitcoin maximalist and owner of Bitcoin Armenia, roped me into
        his exchange as a consultant/operator until late 2022. Post-exchange, I
        re-teamed with Serj to help with post-production on his movie OTTK,
        earning an executive producer credit. We launched "Hooligun Studios,"
        Serj's third studio, which ran for about six months until the end of
        2023.

        Now, I’m focused on several websites for friends and myself, constantly
        exploring new business ideas, and embracing lifelong learning. I thrive
        on change, progress, and new, exciting ventures. My interests span
        movies, TV shows, books, music, video games, podcasts, and more. I
        occasionally write articles and make videos on X.com (Twitter) and
        YouTube, with X being my main platform. I’m also working on the
        Lyovson.com website.

        I’m a tech and AI evangelist, love Apple products, and am generally
        pro-business. I’m critical of both far-left and far-right ideologies. My
        broad interest in sciences—from history to quantum physics—fuels my
        ambition to write a fiction book one day.

      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>{`
          Languages and Literature: Fluent in Armenian, Russian, and English. My
          first books in Russian and English were the Harry Potter series,
          making them my unofficial language tutors.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Tech Journey: My first PC, an Intel Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM, came
          around 2006, running Windows XP, which I soon upgraded to Vista. Part
          of the "Da Vinci Code" craze, I themed my PC accordingly, installed
          Safari and iTunes, and even managed a "Hackintosh" setup. Though I
          wasn't coding back then, I loved tinkering with systems and once
          installed Ubuntu Linux, which I found cool but not as impressive as
          macOS.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Gadget Evolution: My first feature phone came in 2009, my first iPhone
          (a 4S) in 2011, and my first MacBook Pro in 2019.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Gaming Passion: As a kid, I owned a Dendy (a NES clone) and a Sega
          Mega Drive (a Genesis clone), loving classics like Mario, Battle City,
          Sonic, and Mortal Kombat. My serious gaming started with the original
          PlayStation, featuring games like ISS Pro Evolution, Sheep Raider,
          Driver 2, Spyro, Civilization 2, and Warcraft. Now, I enjoy grand
          strategy games like Civilization VI and Paradox titles such as Europa
          Universalis IV and Crusader Kings III, having sunk hundreds of hours
          into them. RimWorld is another favorite.

          Entertainment Favorites:`}
          <ul>
            <li>{`
              Books: While Harry Potter holds a special place, the Dresden Files
              now gives it strong competition.
            `}</li>
            <li>{`
              Movies: I love the first Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy by Gore
              Verbinski, whose debut film "Mouse Hunt" was also my first VHS
              tape. Johnny Depp is a favorite actor, and Eva Green, whom I find
              exceptionally attractive, is my favorite actress.
            `}</li>
            <li>{`
              TV Shows: "Breaking Bad" for drama, "The IT Crowd" and "Community"
              for sitcoms, and "What We Do in the Shadows" for its perfect blend
              of humor and supernatural elements.
            `}</li>
            <li>{`
              Video Games: My favorite game and overall lore come from
              Skyrim/The Elder Scrolls series, with San Andreas also ranking
              high.
            `}</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>{`
          Coffee Aficionado: Passionate about black coffee, I prefer it
          Turkish-style but in a larger cup and not as strong, with no sugar or
          milk.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Acting Cameos: I've played a cop in multiple feature films—a running
          gag in my circles—and a corrupt priest in a famous Armenian rap song's
          music video.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Dynamic Looks: My appearance changes dramatically every few years,
          switching between shoulder-length hair and a shaved head with a short
          goatee, channeling my inner Walter White.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Joni the Cat: Joni, our black and white tomcat with a pink nose and
          green eyes, is 13 years old and weighs a hefty 8.2 kg. This extremely
          intelligent cat is affectionately called Jonik by Jess and me.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Animal Lovers: Both Jess and I are cat people but love most animals.
          We were vegetarians from around 2015 to the 2020 pandemic.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Skill Goals: I have a list of skills to learn: swimming, driving, and
          playing the piano. I learned to swim a bit, but all three are still on
          my to-do list.
        `}</li>
        <li>{`
          Nickname Legacy: Lyovson means "Son of Lyov," after my late father
          Levon "Lyova" Avetisyan. Though we had our ideological differences, my
          father was good people. I've had several nicknames: "Prof" at school,
          "Lord Ra" in the early internet, "Quentin" in showbiz for my
          resemblance to Tarantino, and "Terter" (priest) in the army due to my
          theological background.
